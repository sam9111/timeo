Timeo is a user-friendly desktop application powered by the ChronoJS library, designed to simplify the process of converting date and time information from natural language into the user's local timezone. Users can effortlessly achieve this by merely copying the text to their clipboard using the Ctrl/Cmd+C shortcut. Additionally, Timeo allows manual input of date and time information. This versatile time zone conversion tool is built as a Tauri desktop application and will be released on both macOS and Windows platforms in the near future.
